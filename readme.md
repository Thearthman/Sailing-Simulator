# Crest  
Crest is a technically advanced ocean system for Unity. It is architected for performance and makes heavy use of Level Of Detail (LOD) strategies and GPU acceleration for fast update and rendering. It is also highly flexible and allows any custom input to the water shape/foam/dynamic waves/etcetera, and has an intuitive and easy to use shape authoring interface.>
